# Friend Finder

## Summary
This is a friend-finding app. The user takes a survey to determine who would be a best match for friendship within our app's stored list of potential matches.

## Overview
Created using Node.js, this app takes user input via a survey form web page, conducts the relevant matching of survey answers against potential matches, displays the best match in a modal, and also stores the survey taker's information on our server for other survey takers to match against.
